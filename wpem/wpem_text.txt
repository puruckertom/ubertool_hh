<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) has initiated a Design for the Environment (DfE) Project intended to develop a wall paint exposure assessment model for interior latex and alkyd paints. The Wall Paint Exposure Model (WPEM) employed here has been developed under the Wall Paint DfE project. The EPA is working with the National Paints and Coatings Association (NPCA), in addition to paint manufacturers and chemical suppliers, to develop this model. </p>

<p>The purpose of the planned model is to allow industry product developers and health and safety officials to more easily and accurately identify chemicals in paint formulations that may pose potential exposure problems. It is envisioned that identification and/or evaluation of potentially problematic chemicals will be done by individual paint manufacturers and chemical suppliers during the design stage of paint development and/or during a product-stewardship effort to fully assess a current line of products.</p>
