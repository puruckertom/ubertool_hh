<p>Prior to the 1990's, RfDs and RfCs had been determined from no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs), which represent the highest experimental dose for which no statistically significant adverse health effects were reported or, in the absence of a NOAEL, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAEL). In 1995, EPA's Risk Assessment Forum published guidance on the benchmark dose (BMD) approach in the assessment of non-cancer health risk (U.S. EPA, 1995) which listed several advantages of the BMD approach over use of NOAELs and LOAELs. In 1995, EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) initiated a project to develop benchmark dose software to assist Agency risk assessors in deriving benchmark dose values for use in Agency risk assessments.</p>

<p>This latest version contains thirty (30) different models that are appropriate for the analysis of dichotomous (quantal) data (Gamma, Gamma-BgDose, Dichotomous Hill, Logistic, Logistic-BgResponse, Log-Logistic, Multistage, Multistage-BgDose, Probit, Probit-BgResponse, Log-Probit, Log-Probit-BgDose, Quantal-Linear, Weibull, Weibull-BgDose, Multistage-Cancer and Multistage-Cancer-BgDose), continuous data (Linear, Polynomial, Power, Hill and four (4) Exponential models), nested developmental toxicology data (NLogistic, NCTR, and Rai & Van Ryzin), multiple tumor analysis (multitumor) and concentration-time data (ten Berge and Toxicodiffusion).</p>

<p>Use of BMD methods involve fitting mathematical models to dose-response data and using the different results to select a BMD that is associated with a predetermined benchmark response (BMR), such as a 10% increase in the incidence of a particular lesion or a 10% decrease in body weight gain. BMDS facilitates these operations by providing simple data-management tools and an easy-to-use interface to run multiple models on the same dose-response data set.</p>

<p>Results from all models include a reiteration of the model formula and model run options chosen by the user, goodness-of-fit information, the BMD, and the estimate of the lower-bound confidence limit on the BMD (BMDL).</p>
