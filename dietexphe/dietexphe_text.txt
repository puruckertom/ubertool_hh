<p>HED Dietary exposure model is used to estimate exposure to pesticides in food in the diets of the U.S. population. HED Dietary exposure model can perform acute dietary exposure assessment using either deterministic methods or Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA) techniques when distributions of residue data are used for targeted foods. The main module is used to launch the residue file editor to create and edit residue files for specific chemical or cumulative applications, and to launch the Acute and Chronic/Cancer analysis modules.</p>

<p>The acute and chronic analysis of the model can be used to estimate total exposure for both the U.S. population as a whole and subgroups of the population. Subgroups are divided by age, gender, or ethnicity. The Commodity Contribution Analysis can be used to identify the contribution of residues in individual foods (and food forms) to the overall estimate of dietary exposure.</p>
