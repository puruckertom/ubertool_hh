<p>The HED Gas Calcuatlor is for the calculation of HECs based on inhalation toxicity to gasses to determine RDDRs for regions of respiratory tract.  Application of study results from the use of an aerosol is not appropiate with this model.  HECs based on aerosols are determined by the RDDR and require different calculations.</p>
<p>Before HEC calculations can be performed, NOAEL/LOAELs from an inhaltion study must be determined for the different regions (ET, TB, PU) of the respiratory tract.  The definition of the three regions of the respiratory tract may be found in Table 3-1 of RfC manual (link in the <a href="/hedgas_references.html">References Section</a>).  Please keep in mind that the overall study NOAEL/LOAEL or systemic NOAEL/LOAEL may be different than the inhalation irritation NOAEL/LOAEL.  If a LOAEL is used instead of a NOAEL, then an additional UF may be required.</p>
<p>Another critical factor for calculating HECs is the body weight for the specific species used in the study and the gender in which the effect was observed.  If an effect occured in both genders, then the average body weight of both genders is used in the RfC methodology.  Please refer to the RfC methodology manual (Tables 4-5) for the default body weight values required for calculations.  If CD-1 mice were used in a study, then use the B6C3F1 values.  Please be aware that subchronic body weights listed in Table 4-5 of the RfC manual should be used for the Acute, ST/IT exposure scenarios whereas chronic body weights should be used for the LT exposure scenarios.</p>
