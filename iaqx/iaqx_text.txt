<p>IAQX is short for Simulation Tool Kit for Indoor Air Quality and Inhalation Exposure. Estimation of inhalation exposure to indoor air pollutants is an essential part of multipathway exposure assessment since most people spend a large portion of their time indoors. In the past two decades, a series of IAQ simulation programs have been developed.</p>

<p>IAQX is not intended to replace the existing IAQ simulation packages. Instead, it complements and supplements them by focusing on fundamentally based models. In recent years, modeling of indoor pollutant sources and sinks has gradually shifted from simple, empirical models to more complex, mass transfer models. While the latter have demonstrated improved accuracy, validity, and scalability, their usefulness has somewhat been overshadowed by their increased complexity. Potential users are often scared away at the sight of unfamiliar equations and tedious calculations. To a large extent, the newer models are excluded in the existing IAQ simulation packages. IAQX attempts to resolve this problem by shielding users from mathematical details, allowing them to concentrate on IAQ related issues. IAQX puts relatively simple mass transfer models in the general-purpose simulation program; more complex models are implemented as stand-alone, special-purpose simulation programs.</p>
